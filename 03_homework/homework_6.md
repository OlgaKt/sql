**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

When working with data management, incorporating ethics and considerations of inequity is very important. We need to ensure that data collection methods are unbiased and inclusive. And that we consider the demographic representation in the data and whether certain groups are overrepresented or underrepresented.
Also, it is important to be transparent about data sources, methodologies, and decision-making processes, as well as making sure that sensitive information is handled correctly.
